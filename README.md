In this project I created a simple ticketing app that is supposed to be used by the employees and the customers using the parking

        -Find my car --> used by the customers to locate their car in case they forgot the location
         
        -Help --> option that customers can use to have a chat with the employee (multiple customers can chat with the employee at the same time)

Some of the staff options:

        -Manager:
        
        --Hire/Fire emoplyee --> used to hire/fire employee

        --Forgot password --> in case someone forgot his/hers password

        -Employee:

        --Chat --> option that helps resolving customers issue

        --Parking --> option to mark spot as parked once there is a car in a parking lot, as well as billing the parking
